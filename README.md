# Recipe_web_flask
Website for different recipes using flask. You can choose cocktail or meal(for example you can write: "Cosmoplitan cocktail" and you will see the ingredients and cooking steps). We used different modules like: flask, flask_sqlalchemy, werkzeug.security, flask_login, requests, bs4, time, random.
